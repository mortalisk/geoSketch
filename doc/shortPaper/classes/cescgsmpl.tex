\begin{abstract}
  In the time being the popularity of money is permanently decreasing.
  The question what to do with unusable money arose among the others.
  We would like to consider all aspects of this phenomenon according to the
  present knowledge and the state of the art. We collected huge amount of
  ideas and last ten years we sort them. Unfortunately up to now we have
  not found two of the same category. But our effort is not at the end.

\section{Introduction}

This is the main text of the contribution containing various information on
the topic, which has several aspects including those mentioned in Barry Williams
book~\cite{Williams}. It is not terribly fun for the rest of us.
No one of us can say wht will be in future with money. They are becoming useless.
In this paper, we detail the results of our study.%

This\footnote{This is another note to the text.}
 is the main text of the contribution containing various information on
the topic, which has several aspects including those mentioned in a book by
Karabas~\cite{Karabas}. It is not terribly fun for the rest of us.
No one of us can say what will be in future with money. They are becoming useless.
In this paper, we detail the results of our study. Compare with the literature,
e.g.~\cite{Williams,Karabas}%

In Section~\ref{sec:what}, we describe the present state of methods used in the
 area.
In Section~\ref{sec:who}, we discuss difficulties and describe
 techniques which we subsequently developed (see Figure~\ref{fig:example}) to overcome them.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:why}, we examine the effects of these
 techniques on mind health of the user.
