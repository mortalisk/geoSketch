This distribution provides a document class for formatting papers
according to the specifications for submission to the annual
Central European Seminar on Computer Graphics for students.
It contains four files:

README - this file
cescg.dtx - documented source code
cescg.ins - installation driver
Makefile  - LaTeX configuration file for GNU make

To install it, type
  latex cescg.ins

This will produce 4 more files:
cescg.cls     - the CESCG class file, which should be placed somewhere
                in the TeX search path (you can leave it in your paper directory)
cescgsmpl.tex - an example paper
smplbib.bib   - a small bibliography file used by the example
example.eps   - a small image used by the example

To generate the user's guide, run
  latex cescg.dtx
  makeindex -s gglo.ist -o cescg.gls cescg.glo
  latex cescg.dtx

or simply "make classdoc"

To compile the example, run
  latex cescgsmpl
  bibtex cescgsmpl
  latex cescgsmpl
  latex cescgsmpl

or simply "make dvi". Edit the Makefile to configure it for your paper.
