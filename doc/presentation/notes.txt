 => Deposits


When we now have a river, we want to make it easy to create deposits. By looking at our inspirational picture, it seems that such deposits are created where a river meets the ocean. We therefore imagine a feature where you can specify the sea level like here, and then have a deposit grow automatically from there. The size could be based on the amount and type of land that is being displaced by the river, or you could specify it manually. Another thought we had was to modify the terrain according to how much deposits you want.

Another feature we plan is the ability to create partial layers. That is, laers that do not cover the entire cube, but instead are limited by other layers. This can be done by several methods, for example by drawing intersecting layers, like on this picture, and then removing from the one side of the intersection. It could also be done by drawing directly on the surface where the intersection would be.

===Thank you===
That concludes the presentation. I wrote some talking points here, but feel free to discuss anything you want.
